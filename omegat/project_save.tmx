Yesterday, my cousin, whose power level is at the third stage of the Cast Tripod Realm, went to be a sparring partner for a day, but in the end he left the place crawling.

Deep down in his heart, he was in truth unwilling to lose face in front of a beautiful lady. He knew deep down that his speed would definitely be unable to beat that of Ji Tingyu. As such, he simply decided to stop trying to avoid incoming attacks any further, and instead use his eyes to firmly lock on to Ji Tingyu's hands. With his mind spinning at a quick speed, he was able to estimate his opponent's attack trajectory and in turn stretch his two hands forward like a strand of seaweed. </seg>
